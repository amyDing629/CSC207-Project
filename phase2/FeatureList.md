# Feature List for Phase 2

Since we only have 5 members in total, we did the mandatory extensions, one elective extension and the GUI.

## Mandatory Extension (5 extensions)

### 1. Reverse System

### 2. Automatic Item Suggests
In Request Trade Session, users need to input a second item to request a two-way trade. 
Users need to choose the second item from his "wish to lend" list. 
If an item is both in current user's "wish to borrow list" and in target user's "wish to borrow list", 
then the item will be added to the "suggest list".
On the left side of the frame, the system will print out the users' "wish to lend list" and "suggest list".

### 3. Explore System 

### 4. ClientUser Limit System

### 5. Another status for accounts??

## Chosen Extension (3 extensions)

### 4 - Points System
For each complete trade, the user will get one bonus point. The user can redeem points to get bonus trades. 
The bonus trade is an extra chance for users to trade without it counting towards being frozen.
Each bonus trade is worth 5 points. The admin can change the "exchange standard" (the number of points needed for one bonus trade) in ClientUser Limit System.

### 8 - GUI
Watch videos to see how to use the GUI system.
