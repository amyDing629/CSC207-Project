# Feature List for Phase 2

Since we only have 5 members in total, we did the mandatory extensions, one elective extension and the GUI.

## Mandatory Extension (5 extensions)

### 1. Reverse System

### 2. Automatic Item Suggests

### 3. Explore System 

### 4. ClientUser Limit System

### 5. Another status for accounts??

## Chosen Extension (3 extensions)

### 4 - Points System
For each complete trade, the user will get one bonus point. The user can redeem points to get bonus trades. 
The bonus trade is an extra chance for user to trade without it counting towards being frozen.
Each bonus trade is worth 5 points. The admin can change the "exchange standard" (the number of points needed for one bonus trade) in ClientUser Limit System.

### 8 - GUI
